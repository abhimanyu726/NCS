# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on various factors like age, gender, class, and more. The goal is to understand how these features influenced the survival outcomes and build a model that can accurately predict survival probabilities.
